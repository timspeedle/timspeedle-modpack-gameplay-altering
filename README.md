# Description
This modpack is a curated list of mods that I use to alter the gameplay of Factorio. Several of the more significantly gameplay altering mods are listed as optional dependencies.

# Configuration Changes
There are some significant changes to existing mods default settings, if you include this modpack, be aware of these changes:

## [AAI Industry](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/aai-industry)
The Big mining drill is **disabled** due to the inclusion of `bobmining`

## [Bio Industries](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Bio_Industries)
All of the global settings except for tree collision box size are disabled. I primarily use the Powered Rails item from this mod.

## [Combat Mechanics Overhaul](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/combat-mechanics-overhaul)
All of the multipliers are reset to 100% instead of the default values from the mod. Personally I don't find biter combat to be a very enjoyable a part of the gameplay loop, so I'm not interested in making them even more annoying.

## [Even Distribution](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/even-distribution)
Inventory cleanup is globally disabled.

## [Project Cybersyn](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/cybersyn)
The indev UI screen is enabled.

# Optional Dependencies
The following mods are included as optional dependencies. I do enjoy the gameplay changes that they offer, but they are relatively drastic changes, and so sometimes I won't use them. Personally, it depends on the mechanics introduced by the other modpacks in the playthrough.

* [Factorissimo 2 - notnotmelon fork](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/factorissimo-2-notnotmelon)
* [Transport Drones](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Transport_Drones)
